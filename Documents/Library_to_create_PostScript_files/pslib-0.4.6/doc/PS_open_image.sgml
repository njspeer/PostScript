<!-- Process this file with docbook-to-man to generate an nroff manual
     page: `docbook-to-man manpage.sgml > manpage.1'.  You may view
     the manual page with: `docbook-to-man manpage.sgml | nroff -man |

manpage.1: manpage.sgml

	The docbook-to-man binary is found in the docbook-to-man package.
	Please remember that if you create the nroff version in one of the
	debian/rules file targets (such as build), you will need to include
	docbook-to-man in your Build-Depends control field.

    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para>Reads an image which is already available in memory. The parameter
		  <parameter>source</parameter> is currently not evaluated and assumed
			to be `memory'. The parameter <parameter>type</parameter> can be either
			`raw' or `eps'. Images in raw format are expected to be a stream of pixels
			starting in the upper left and ending in the lower right corner. Each
			pixel is a tuple of components representing the colors. Each component
			consists of <parameter>bpc</parameter> bit. Color imgags expect the
			components to be stored in RGB or CMYK order. The number of components
			implies the colorspace. 4 components imply a CMYK image and not an
			RGB image with an alpha channel. This restriction may be removed in
			later versions.</para>
		<para>EPS images are expect as stored in a file. There is no need to
		  set any other paramter. The height und width of the image is
			taken from the bounding box within the image data.</para>
		<para>Since version 0.4.5 of pslib images are read by default for later
			reuse. This means that the image is saved into a so called reusable
			stream object. Later calls of <function>PS_place_image(3)</function>
			will only put a short
			sequence of postscript code into the output file replaying the image.
			This reduces the overall postscript file size, speeds up its processing by
			the postscript rip and allows to place images into templates. This
			behaviour can be turned off by setting the parameter `imagereuse'
			to false with <function>PS_set_parameter(3)</function>.</para>

    <title>RETURN VALUE</title>
    <para>Returns identifier of the image or zero in case of an error.
		  The identifier is a positiv number greater 0.</para>
