	- added support for reusable images
	- updated man pages

Version 0.4.4
	- fixed impropper use of font in ps_stringwidth() (thanks to Roger Wimbert)

Version 0.4.3
	- renamed getline() to afm_getline() in ps_afm.c because never versions
	  of libc have an equal symbol

Version 0.4.2
	- fixed bug in ps_setcolor()
	- made src/hash_table.c compile on hp ux
	- fixed typo in input encoding table
	- fixed man pages
	- fixed several memory leaks

Version 0.4.1
	- fixed DSC in postscript file (makes ghostview for ms windows happy)
	- configuring using cmake now checks for libpng, libjpeg, libtiff, libz

Version 0.4.0
	- Also disolve a ligature if it isn't present in the font encoding vector
	- handle duplicate glyphs in an afm file nicely, without leaking memory
	- many small changes to make it compile for win32 in a mingw and
		visual C environment (includes support for cmake)
	- added function PS_glyph_list() which returns a list of all glyphs
	  in a font. Free that list with PS_free_glyph_list()
	- added function PS_glyph_width() which returns the width of a glyph
	- changed mode of fopen to "rb" to make it work in win32
	- added functions PS_[begin|end]_font(), PS_[begin|end]_glyph()
	  for creating Type3 fonts
	- added functions PS_add_kerning(), PS_add_ligature() for setting
	  kerning pairs and ligatures of a font.
	- added PS_glyph_show() for outputting a glyph by its name.
	- fixed sourceforge bug 1556247, 'ordmaskuline' must be 'ordmasculine'

Version 0.3.0
	- PS_string_geometry() uses the passed font and not the current font
	  (Closes #1711438 at sourceforge)
	- added section about color separation in man page of pslib
	- check for byteswap.h because mingw doesn't have it
	- default error handler now prints to stderr instead of stdout (reported
	  by Johannes Frank, fixes debian bug #429544)
	- parbreak has no effect if linebreak is set (previous segm reported
	  by Johannes Frank, fixes debian bug #429543)
	- BMP support can be disabled
	- PS_place_image() doesn't check for mimetypes of unsupported image
	  formats
	- support for separating colors. Just set the value 'separationcolor'
	  before creating a new page to 1-4 (1=cyan, 2=magenta, ...)
	- added missing include file for freebsd
	- Support for other input encodings (currently only latin1 and latin2, more
	  can be easily added)
	- Replaced TeXBase1 by Cork fontencoding because it supports more glyphs
	- ps_check_for_lig() gets extra first parameter *psdoc in order to be able
	  to access the inputencoding stored in psdoc

Version 0.2.7
	- fixed setting of locale
	- PS_set_border_style() works as expected
	- added blind feature to PS_show_boxed()
	- added support for gif, tiff and bmp images
	- PS_show_boxed() sets the value 'boxheight' to the actual height of
	  the box. This is useful if you specify a height of 0.0 for the
		box and need to find out how high is has become. It is also useful
		if a box isn't completely filled.
	- passing a height of 0.0 to PS_show_boxed() will create a box long enough
	  to contain all text.
	- strip alpha channel from rgb pngs, because they cause a segm fault. Once
	  I understand where the actual problem lies, it will be reenabled.
	- make euro symbol work (replaces the currency symbol)
	- PS_arc() and PS_arcn() behave like the arc and arcn postscript commands
	- fixed rpm spec file
	- PS_continue_text() finally works as expected
	- PS_get_buffer() checks for psdoc->sb before accessing it
	- PS_begin_page() does not overwrite the BoundingBox and Orientation
	  anymore, if it has been explicitly set by PS_set_info()

Version 0.2.6
	- added dotted version of pslib to Creator field of postscript header
	- PS_add_bookmarks() works even with characters in the bookmark text
	  which are not allowed in PostScript strings (like '(', ')')
	- PS_open_image() can read eps images from memory
	- fixed encoding vectors at position 363-365
	- jpeg cmyk images can be read without segm fault
	- char to disolve ligatures can be set as parameter 'ligaturedisolvechar'
	- Entering PS_PATH_SCOPE always starts a new PostScript path
	  (newpath). This fixes the clipping bug.
	- both, grayscale and rgb jpeg images can be read

Version 0.2.5
	- fixed ascii85 encoding
	- fixed memory leak in PS_find_font() and PS_include_file()
	- various fixes which caused segm fault under solaris

	- support for graphic states (PS_create_gstate(), PS_set_gstate())
	- support for shading patterns (PS_shading(), PS_shfill(),
	  PS_shading_pattern())
	- fixed bug when calling PS_save(), take over old gstate
	- can now read jpeg images
	- image data is being ascii85 encoded to reduce file size
	- Fixed bug in PS_fill_stroke(), invalid PostScript because of missing space

Version 0.2.2
	- access inputencoding vector through ps_inputenc_naem() which uses
	  the encoding vector of the document.
	- implemented search path (parameter SearchPath), it is used for all
	  files opened for reading, e.g. afm, pfb, enc and all include files.
	- Enforce calling PS_setfont() on each page
	- fixed some potential segm faults
	- protusion can be turned off with the parameter 'protusion' set to false
	- fixed memory leak caused by addkern() which isn't used
	- fixed PS_mp_realloc() which was very broken
	- implemented PS_get_buffer() and real in memory document creation

Version 0.2.1
	- many man page updates
	- PS_findfont() can be called between pages if the default encoding is
	  used and the font is not embedded.
	- PS_get_paramter() can return current scope
	- initial separation of fill and stroke color
	- check parameter c1-c4 of PS_setcolor() for being in range 0-1.0
	- PS_setcolor() accepts 'fillstroke' as second parameter to set both
	  stroke and fill color.
	- use PostScript commands setgraycolor, setrgbcolor, setcmykcolor and
	  setpattern because some PostScript programs for color separation
		rely on it.
	- added functions PS_setoverprint() and PS_makespotcolor()
	- Resources will be put into the prolog if they are created before
	  the the first page. This allows to extract certain pages from the
		document without missing the resources in the new document.
	- added new scope PS_SCOPE_OBJECT, PS_SCOPE_PROLOG

Version 0.2.0
	- ps_fontenc_code() returns a '?' if the glyph could not be found

	  how to use the library.
	- added function PS_set_text_pos()
	- much better handling of builtin font encoding
	- allow to get more values of a font with PS_get_value()
	- New functons PS_symbol(), PS_symbol_width(), PS_symbol_name()
	- PS_get_value() evaluates parameter modifier if font specific
	  values like fontsize, capheight, etc. are requested. modifier is the
		font id.
	- PS_show2() did not use textx and texty
	- renamed PS_stringwidth3() to PS_string_geometry()

Version 0.1.13
	- PS_hyphenate() better handles non alpha chars
	- updated man pages

Version 0.1.12
	- much better hyphenation of words with capital letters and words starting
	  with none alpha charaters like '('
	- huge speed improvement if PS_show_boxed() is called several times and
	  hyphenation is turned on, because the hyphenation table is now loaded once.
	- added fulljustify mode for PS_show_boxed()

Version 0.1.11

	- drawing arcs, circle and rectangles adds only those lines to the
	  current path which belong to the object
	- added functions to set and check the current scope

Version 0.1.7
	- detect ligatures made of three and more characters
	- many man page updates
	- configure option --with-png works (even --with-png=no to disable png
	  support)
	- default memory management functions and errorhandler renamed to _ps_xxx()
	- parameter text passed to PS_show_boxed() is not modified anymore because
	  the function makes a copy of it.
	- fixed potential segm fault in PS_show2() when text has more than 299
	  chars, no space and kerning is turned off.
	- Underlining is not using the descender as set in the font metrics but
	  the one calculated for the text to show. This places the under line
		much closer to the text if the text has no descender.

	- dvips encoding can be loaded to define more ligatures
	- consider ligatures in PS_stringwidth2()
	- initial support for different input/font encodings

Version 0.1.5
	- echo warning if character is not in input encoding or glyph is not
	  in font.
	- put fontenc, inputenc into its own file.
	- major speed up when outputing text (a 300 page document, each
	  page containing about 3000 characters needs now about 10 sec as
	  opposed to 70 sec for creation.)

Version 0.1.4
	- improved different ways of text rendering
	- support for output of invisible text
	- added pkgconfig and *.la files to rpm devel package
	- check if resource exists before creating a new one

Version 0.1.3

	- fixed some nasty compile errors
	- added more BuildDepends

Version 0.1.2

	- added PS_arcn(), PS_add_weblink(), PS_add_pdflink(), PS_add_launchlink(),
	  PS_set_border_style(), PS_set_border_color(), PS_set_border_dash(),
		PS_add_locallink(), PS_add_bookmark(), PS_add_note() (Uwe)
	- added many manpages (Uwe)
	- added multi language support and german translation (Uwe)
